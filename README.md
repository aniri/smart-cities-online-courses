## About

I looked online for free MOOCs that would offer a strong background for anyone interested in Smart cities. The structure is inspired from [The Dual Masterâ€™s in Sustainable Smart Cities](http://www.staffs.ac.uk/postgraduate/smartcities/programmedetails/) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Staffordshire University. I will continue to improve the list as I find new courses.

## Preparation

A great MOOC that gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. 

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) :pizza:

Also I think MOOCs for learning how to use solution-based journalism to impel positive social change would also prove useful :)
