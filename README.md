## About

## Preparation

A great MOOC that gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. 

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

Also I think MOOCs for learning how to use solution-based journalism to impel positive social change would also prove useful :)
